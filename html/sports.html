It was December 2nd, 2015, when I first mounted a Dark Bay Marwari horse named Rising Sun. Shortly after, I experienced my inaugural jump, an exhilarating moment that left me ecstatic. On December 15th, 2015, I entered my first competition, The Punjab State Equestrian Championship in Jalandhar. It was there that I clinched my maiden medal, with more victories following suit. My forte lies in Show Jumping.-->
