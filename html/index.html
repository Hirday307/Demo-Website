            I am Hirdayjeet Singh Bhandal, proud to hail from Punjab, India. My academic journey commenced at Shakti Public Sen. Sec. School, Shanewal, a foundation laid under my family's guidance. Transitioning to The Punjab Public School, Nabha in 2015 marked a pivotal moment where I completed my Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (Class X) and Indian School Certificate (Class XII).

                Now, I embark on a new chapter at McMaster University, renowned for its commitment to academic excellence. Enrolled in the esteemed Bachelor of Computer Science Applied Science CO-OP 1 program, I am drawn to the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence. McMaster's distinguished legacy and pioneering research environment promise to nurture my aspirations and foster impactful contributions to its academic community.
                
                Beyond academics, my passion for Show Jumping blossomed at PPS Nabha, complemented by active involvement in global Round Square conferences and service projects. Recognized for achievements such as the Most Improved Student award and leadership roles in cultural and community initiatives, I aspire to channel my experiences into driving positive change and innovation in every endeavor.
