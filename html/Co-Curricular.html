           <div> greetings!!<br>I am Hirdayjeet Singh Bhandal from Punjab, India. During my school years, I immersed myself in a variety of co-curricular activities. I was a key member of organizing committees for various events and proudly served as Captain of Jumna House. Achieving the Most Improved Student of the passing batch 2024 prize was a significant honor for me.Additionally, I was actively involved in the Round Square society, participating in conferences and service projects. A highlight of my school experience was showcasing Punjabi culture through Bhangra performances, which I choreographed and presented at several events. Despite not being naturally gifted, through practice, dedication, and discipline, I gradually perfected my skills. Engaging in activities such as poetical recitation, public speaking, and anchoring further shaped my leadership and communication abilities. These experiences have not only enriched my school life but also prepared me for future endeavors with confidence and resilience.</div>
